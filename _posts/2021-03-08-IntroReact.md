# Introducing new series on React

Welcome to the React saga, where every div dreams of greatness and state changes faster than my morning motivation. If you've ever wanted to turn simple web development into a mind-bending puzzle of hooks, components, and occasional breakdowns, you're in the right place. We’ll be deep-diving into React, where ‘easy’ is a relative term and useEffect will keep you up at night. Buckle up—by the end of this, you'll either be a React pro or staring blankly at your screen wondering why your button won’t render.
